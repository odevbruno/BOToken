ERC-20 Token Contract
This repository contains the implementation of an ERC-20 token contract in Solidity. The contract consists of two main parts: `ERC20Token` and `SampleERC20`.

## ERC20Token
`ERC20Token` is a library that implements the basic functionalities of an ERC-20 contract. It includes methods for token transfer, approval of spending by third parties, and querying balance and allowances.

## SampleERC20
`SampleERC20` is a contract that inherits from `ERC20Token` and defines a specific token. It allows the creation of new ERC-20 tokens with customizable parameters, including name, symbol, number of decimal places, and total token supply.

## Compilation and Deployment
To compile and deploy this contract, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local development environment.
2. Compile the contract using the Solidity compiler.
3. Deploy the contract to a compatible Ethereum network, such as the Ropsten test network or Ganache.

## Usage
After deploying the contract, you can interact with it through appropriate function calls such as `transfer`, `approve`, `transferFrom`, and others, depending on your specific needs. Be sure to refer to the official contract documentation for detailed information about available functions.

## Security Considerations
This contract is a basic implementation and can be expanded with more functionalities, but keep security considerations in mind when doing so. Perform thorough security audits before deploying this contract to a production environment to ensure it meets appropriate security standards.
